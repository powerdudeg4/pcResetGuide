# Section 1: Reinstalling Windows from a USB drive
It's definetely easier to use a bootable USB drive rather than the built in tools, and also means you have an installation media you can borrow to someone if they will need one as well.

First, start by going into the **System Information**, check the line **BIOS Mode**, if it says **Legacy** then you MUST install Windows in Legacy mode, if you get UEFI - you have UEFI.

I am unable to access Windows. What do I do? 
Go into BIOS, chances are you may see an option called **BIOS Mode**, leave it to the default value. 
Generally newer computers will use UEFI while older ones will most likely use BIOS.

Now - obtain a Windows Install ISO

Windows 10 ISO is avaiable here: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10

Either use their tool or burn the ISO yourself using Rufus
